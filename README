WELCOME TO THE ZENOWARE ROSYLN PARSER GITHUB PROJECT!

--GETTING STARTED
FIRST THING YOU WILL NEED TO DO IS INSTALL THE CSMS METRICS TOOL IN ORDER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS SOFTWARE. 
THE CSMS METRICS TOOL CAN BE OBTAINED FROM THE VISUAL STUDIO GALLERY <http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/7c587897-395e-47e1-98fd-811adad3d7f7> OR FROM ZENOWARE'S WEBSITE <http://www.zenoware.com/Installers/CSMS_Roslyn.exe>.

--WHAT IS INCLUDED?
THERE ARE TWO C# PROJECTS INCLUDED THAT YOU WILL NEED IN ORDER TO MODIFY THE METRICS TOOL:
-CSMS.CSMSSDK.MODEL
THIS SOURCE IS THE CODE MODEL FOR THE CSMS METRICS TOOL AS WELL AS THE OBJECTS POPULATED DURING PARSING. MODIFYING THIS WILL ALSO ALLOW FLEXIBILITY WHEN USING AND CREATING METRIC SCRIPTS.
-CSMS.CSMSSDK.ROSLYN
THIS SOURCE INCLUDES THE ROSLYN DLLS PROVIDED BY MICROSOFT (UNDER THE APACHE 2.0 LICENSE). IT ALSO INCLUDES MAPPING THE C# AND VB PARSED TOKENS INTO THE CSMS OBJECT MODEL.

--COMPILING THE SOURCE
ZENOWARE PREFERS THAT YOU BUILD IN DEBUG ONLY DUE TO THE BUILD EVENTS. AFTER ENOUGH CHANGES ARE MADE, WE WILL INCLUDE THE COMMUNITY'S CHANGES TO ANY NEW RELEASE OF THE TOOL SO EVERYONE CAN BENIFIT FROM THE CHANGES AT INSTALL.
TO COMPILE THE SOURCE, YOU WILL ONLY NEED TO BUILD IN VISUAL STUDIO 2012 OR VISUAL STUDIO 2013 AT THIS TIME. (NOTE: MAY NEED TO INSTALL ROSYLN <http://roslyn.codeplex.com/> BUT NOT SURE IF IT IS REQUIRED AT THE MOMENT)

--CHANGING THE SOURCE
AFTER YOU HAVE INSTALLED THE CSMS METRICS TOOL, MAKE NOTE WHERE THE INSTALL IS LOCATED AS YOU WILL REPLACE THE EXISTING CSMS.CSMSSDK.MODEL.DLL AND CSMS.CSMSSDK.ROSLYN.DLL WITH YOUR NEWLY COMPILED VERSION. SINCE THE DEBUG CONFIGURATION IS EXPECTED TO BE USED FOR COMMUNITY EFFORTS, IT MAY BE EASIER TO ADD THE FOLLOWING TO THE END OF THE POST-BUILD EVENT TO BOTH CSMS.CSMSSDK.MODEL AND CSMS.CSMSSDK.ROSLYN PROJECTS:

else (
xcopy /Y /F /I /R "$(TargetDir)$(TargetName).*" "<CSMS INSTALL DIRECTORY>"
)

--OTHER NOTES
YOU CAN ALSO USE THIS SOFTWARE TO CREATE YOUR OWN TOOL AS LONG AS YOU FOLLOW THE LICENSE FOR THE SOURCE YOU USE. IF THERE IS AN ISSUE FOLLOWING THESE LICENSES, FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ZENOWARE AT ADMIN@ZENOWARE.COM.
